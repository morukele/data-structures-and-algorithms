# Data Structure and Algorithms

This repo hold the exercies of my data structure and algorithm course I am following. All algorithms are stressed tested to ensure that they do not break or give wrong solutions.

## Exercieses

- Max Pairwise Multiplication

  - Naive solution (3n)
  - Fast solution (2n + 2)
  - Faster solution (2.5n)

- Divisor and Multiple
  
  - Greatest common division
  - Least common multiple

- Fibonacci Numbers

  - nth Fibonacci number (recursive)
  - Last digit of the nth Fibonacci number (modulo 10)
  - nth Fibonacci number modulo m
  - Pisano period and length
  - Last digit of the sum of the nth Fibonacci number
  - Last digit of the partial sum of the nth Fibonacci number
