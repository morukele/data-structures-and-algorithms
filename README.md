# Data Structure and Algorithms

This repo hold the exercies of my data structure and algorithm course I am following.

*All algorithms are stressed tested to ensure that they do not break or give wrong solutions.*

## Exercieses

### Max Pairwise Multiplication

1. Divisor and multiple
2. Greatest common division
3. Least common multiple

### Fibonacci Numbers

1. nth Fibonacci number (recursive)
2. Last digit of the nth Fibonacci number (modulo 10)
3. nth Fibonacci number modulo m
4. Pisano period and length
5. Last digit of the sum of the nth Fibonacci number
6. Last digit of the partial sum of the nth Fibonacci number
  
### Gready Algorithms

1. Money change problem
2. Maximum value of the loot
3. Maximum advertisment Revenue
4. Collecting signatures
5. Maximum number of prizes
6. Maximum salary
