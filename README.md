# Data Structure and Algorithms

This repo hold the exercies of my data structure and algorithm course I am following. All algorithms are stressed tested to ensure that they do not break or give wrong solutions.

## Exercieses

- Max Pairwise Multiplication

  - Naive solution (3n)
  - Fast solution (2n + 2)
  - Faster solution (2.5n)
